# Dockerfiles :whale:

A list of all my docker files.

## What do you keep here?
Private backups of personal dockerfiles as well as compose files.

If I find a nice new service/program and it isn't contained quite well (or at all), I'll add it here.

## Why docker as the container engine?

I like whales.
